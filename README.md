Computer Vision Basics
Foundational computer vision experiments — from image handling to training a basic classifier.

🖼️ Image Test
Loaded and saved images using OpenCV

🎞️ Video Test
Played video files and applied speed control (fast-forward & slow motion)

📷 Webcam Test
Captured real-time webcam input frame by frame

✂️ Cropping
Cropped images by selecting pixel ranges manually

📏 Resizing
Resized images to fixed dimensions for processing

🎨 Colorspaces
Converted images between BGR, RGB, and HSV using cv2.cvtColor

🌫️ Blurring
Applied Gaussian, Median, and Normal blur filters

⚫ Thresholding
Converted images into binary format to simplify details

🧠 Edge Detection
Detected object boundaries using edge and line filters

🧱 Drawing
Drew shapes, text, and highlights over frames

🔍 Contours
Detected and highlighted contours in objects

🔤 Text Detection
Used OCR to detect and extract text from images

🍕 Image Classification
Built a basic image classifier using SVM to detect pizza vs burgers
